# 🔥 FedSpecNet
An advanced method that combines federated learning, representation learning, and deep learning is proposed for household energy consumption forecasting.

# 📚 Requirements
Dependent libraries are placed in a file named 'requirements.txt'.
Requirements(Briefly):  
python==3.7.8  
torch==1.7.1  
torchvision==0.8.2  
torchaudio==0.7.2  
pandas  
matplotlib  
scikit-learn  

# 📒 Usage
1. Run 'Center.py' in Server. Run 'iT_SSAx.py' in Client-x. 
2. Modify the corresponding 'host' and 'port' code case by case.
